# Sudoku-game

Implemented a classic and regular 9X9 grid sudoku game using backtracking and a recursive algorithm. 
The player is allowed to add, delete and change the entered value. 
For every wrong value that is entered by the player, cross is displayed. 
The board solves itself when spacebar is pressed.
